🔥 A place for things to land

    I'm writing a math thesis with my friend and collegaue David Jaz Myers. It's meant to be a tight-end-to-end story. David is blessed (and cursed) with having SO MANY GOOD IDEAS. And so whenever he has a good idea that doesn't fit into the tight end-to-end story, I tell him "put it in the secret Part 2". The secret part 2 is a bunch of chapters along the lines of "Imagine this tight end-to-end story but with this cool additional feature!". And so I think we also need a section of each blog post that's like a secret part II.

    I'm nervous that I feel like I can't write in a post.

    Project idea: I want to have tag for markdown where i can view two authors in different fonts


📝 Sophie's blog post

hello. This post is not interesting

# What did we ship?

# How did we get here?

## **some preamble**

The kingdom of heaven is that sometimes we can generate order and that we can accept and extend grace.

I’d like to ship some software today. Before I begin (inadvisably) I'm trying to remember why.

Sophie and I have a harebrained scheme inspired by Inkhaven to ship a working piece of software every work day in the month of December. I’m toying with calling it Ship December but she has yet to sign off. “December” would be a formidable name for a ship I think.

As far as a shared plan goes, all we have at this time is some text messages saying “let’s do it.”

# What else happened today?

## Jarred wrote down **some thoughts on gnawing one's bone**

I have a bone that I would like to gnaw. It's about penetration into deep knots… it's about progress. 

My bone is about confusion, that’s true. It's about coherence. It's about "*what do you mean by that?*" and how it is like to say and hear that sentence many times in one conversation.

My bone is about deeply tangled whispers I think. Some asides and definitions on all this to follow.

\---

Something is tangled when it must move freely yet it cannot because there’s too much of itself too close together.

\---

Years ago I told John Salvatier: "*I very often feel like I've left the oven on*".

John resonated with this quite deeply. This was quite an important occasion to us both. Lately I've been referring to this feeling as "the whispers".

The most recent case of whispers I can recall I got while reading an EA x Buddhism [memoir](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09FFQSMLK?ref=KC_GS_GB_CA). It brought back the original ideas, mindset, and feelings I had when discovering EA. I overheard various ovens in me which have been left in an on position ever since.

\---

Annie Dillard in “The Writing Life” introduced me to this phrase: “*gnaw your own bone*.” It’s been on my mind recently. Here is the quote.

*There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain.  It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; ...give voice to this, your own astonishment.* 

*“The most demanding part of living a lifetime as an artist is the strict discipline of forcing oneself to work steadfastly along the nerve of one’s own most intimate sensitivity.” Anne Truitt, the sculptor, said this.* 

*Thoreau said it another way: know your own bone. “Pursue, keep up with, circle round and round your life…. Know your own bone: gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw at it still.”*

I don’t know if I have the discipline or the finesse to work steadfastly along the nerve of my most intimate sensitivity. Gnawing at a bone is more inelegant and seems more achievable.

Last Friday I spent several hours writing at my kitchen table. I got up to chop broccoli. It would be cool if I could say aloud to something "*read that back to me*" and hear what I wrote through my headphones. It would be cool if I could pause and play and rewind and make edits with my voice while I cook.

It would be cool if I could say aloud "I feel worse today, I wonder perhaps it was the beans or the large portion size” and it would go in the spreadsheet where it needs to live.

Part of what's going on with whispers is that I remember I had relevant thoughts about a subject that I've never seen written down but I don't remember what they were or in what context I had them.
