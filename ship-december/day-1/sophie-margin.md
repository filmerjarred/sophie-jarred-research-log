I'm writing a math thesis with my friend and collegaue David Jaz Myers. It's meant to be a tight-end-to-end story. David is blessed (and cursed) with having SO MANY GOOD IDEAS. And so whenever he has a good idea that doesn't fit into the tight end-to-end story, I tell him "put it in the secret Part 2". The secret part 2 is a bunch of chapters along the lines of "Imagine this tight end-to-end story but with this cool additional feature!". And so I think we also need a section of each blog post that's like a secret part II.

I'm nervous that I feel like I can't write in a post.
