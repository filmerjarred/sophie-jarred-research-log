**what's going on?**

It's the 1st of December 2025.

It's 6.30am for me in Hamilton Canada. Sophie is asleep as for her it's currently 3.30am in Berkley.

I (we?) have the intention to ship some software today. Before I begin I'm trying to remember why (perhaps inadvisable).

Sophie and I have a harebrained research scheme. We were inspired by Inkhaven to commit ourselves to ship a working piece of software every workday in the month of December. I’m toying with calling it Ship December but she has yet to sign off on this. “December” would be a formidable name for a ship I think.

As far as a plan goes all we have at this time is some text messages saying “let’s do it.”

Some questions which reasonably present themselves at this juncture:

* What counts as having successfully shipped?

* What happens if we fail to ship?

* Is it okay that I (Jarred) have written a minor essay about gnawing bones (below) in which I use a lot of “I” statements and not “We” statements?

* Is it okay that I’ve just jumped ahead and written a caffeinated provisional plan in which we ship a webpage which records a message to a google doc?

Hopefully Sophie can answer these and more when she wakes up.

**FAQ (F=1)**

I am awake\!

Q: What counts as having successfully shipped?\
A: First we say some words about an idea. Then later we can click some buttons on our phones and/or laptops and then a related reliably cool thing related happens on the screen. The cool thing needs to be available to others to use over the public internet.

Q: What happens if we fail to ship?\
A: If we miss one day, then we admit our failure to Harri and he is egregiously disappointed in us. Or we aren't allowed to wear a coat the next day. If we miss two days in a row, then the project is over.

Q: Is it okay that I (Jarred) have written a minor essay about gnawing bones (below) in which I use a lot of “I” statements and not “We” statements?\
A: This question is in fact the whole project.

Q: Is it okay that I’ve just jumped ahead and written a caffeinated provisional plan in which we ship a webpage which records a message to a google doc?\
A: :O YES. Can I see?\!?

**a plan**

Ok. Here is a potential plan for today.

We could make a webpage which implements a simple design pattern. The design pattern is this:

1. I have a thought, the structure and content of which I would like to remember later

2. I tap a button or icon on my phone (which is for better or worse almost always to hand)

3. I speak my thought at my phone

4. This is sufficient to have words reflecting my speech end up in a more durable form than my memory, say in a google doc.

I got more excited about Sophie's idea than I was about my plan for a recording webpage.

One definition of a system 4 is a system which let's life and information flow amoung people without getting too tangled.

*[ Jarred 1pm ]*

**the rules for today**

1. These rules will evolve. Maybe in the future they will only evolve via addition only and never subtraction or modification.

2. We must publish a blog post over 500 words every workday.

3. We must ship a publically available and usable piece of software every day.

4. If we miss one day, then we admit our failure to Harri and he is egregiously disappointed in us. Or we aren't allowed to wear a coat the next day. If we miss two days in a row, then the project is over.

**an aside regarding bones and the gnawing thereof**

I have a bone that I would like to gnaw this month. It's about penetration into deep knots… it's about progress. 

My bone is about confusion, that’s true. It's about coherence. It's about "*what do you mean by that?*" and how it is to say and hear that many times in a conversation.

My bone is about deeply tangled whispers I think. Some definitions to follow.

\---

Something is tangled when it must move freely yet it cannot.

\---

Years ago I told John Salvatier: "*I very often feel like I've left the oven on*".

John resonated with this quite deeply. This was quite an important occasion to us both. Lately I've been referring to this feeling as "the whispers".

The most recent case of whispers I can recall I got while reading an EA x Buddhism [memoir](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09FFQSMLK?ref=KC_GS_GB_CA). It brought back the original ideas, mindset, and feelings I had when discovering EA. I felt the ovens in me which have been left in an on position ever since.

\---

Annie Dillard in “The Writing Life” introduced me to this phrase: “*gnaw your own bone*. It's quite good. Here is the quote.

*There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain.  It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; ...give voice to this, your own astonishment.* 

*“The most demanding part of living a lifetime as an artist is the strict discipline of forcing oneself to work steadfastly along the nerve of one’s own most intimate sensitivity.” Anne Truitt, the sculptor, said this.* 

*Thoreau said it another way: know your own bone. “Pursue, keep up with, circle round and round your life…. Know your own bone: gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw at it still.”*

I don’t know if I have the discipline or the finesse to work steadfastly along the nerve of my most intimate sensitivity. Gnawing at a bone though is more inelegant and seems more achievable.

\---

Last Friday I spent several hours writing at my kitchen table. I got up to chop broccoli. It would be cool if I could say aloud to something "*read that back to me*" and hear what I wrote through my headphones. It would be cool if I could pause and play and rewind and make edits with my voice while I cook.

I don't know that this is my bone exactly but I think it's on the way down.

It would be cool if I could say aloud "I feel worse today, I wonder perhaps it was the beans or the large portion size” and it would go in the spreadsheet where it needs to live.

Part of what's going on with whispers I think is that I'm always recalling that I had relevant thoughts about a subject which I've never seen written down elsewhere but also I don't remember what they were or in what context I had them. Just that they were.

This can be somewhat tangling.

*[ Sophie 2pm ]* I'm nervous that I feel like I can't write in a blog post.

**We shipped!**

We shipped a minimum viable version of the following system:

1. There is a [git repository](https://github.com/filmerjarred/sophie-jarred-research-log) with a folder named `ship-december` inside it.

2. The `ship-december` folder has sub folders like `day-1`, `day-2`, etc.

3. If we create a markdown file called `post.md` in the `day-1` folder of the git repo then it it will magically be available on the public internet to view on our website like so! [sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-1](https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-1)

**another exchange**

*[ Sophie 4pm ]* I don't get this opening line about the kingdom of heaven.

*[ Jarred 4pm ]* I have a weakness for starting essays with a cryptic bit of poetry which I imagine sort of underlies the whole thing.

*[ Jarred 6.30pm to himself ]* What does it mean?

*[ Jarred 6.30pm to himself ]* It's like... there is a place for humanity that I belive is possible... that I have hope about... it's possible for this place to exist because this faculty for recognising and generating clarity and order exists. Like our external world can in-fact improve, we can improve it and make it kinder to inhabit. That's real. Some Christians I know might call this capacity "rightousness", "justice" or "integrity". Rightousness as a focus alone can react with the human prepensity for shame and collapse. If you create a link between actions and a way of being (rightousness) and good desierable outcomes then it can stand to reason that bad outcomes, mess, etc can be attributed to character flaw. Shame and lived experience that I am not good enough creates disorder. This becomes quite a tangle. For the Kingdom to feel reachable then I need both recognition and striving for order and I also need to constantly be inviting myself and accepting invitations and offering invitations into a state of grace... anyway.

**🔥 A place for things to land**

I'm writing a math thesis with my friend and collegaue David Jaz Myers. It's meant to be a tight-end-to-end story. David is blessed (and cursed) with having SO MANY GOOD IDEAS. And so whenever he has a good idea that doesn't fit into the tight end-to-end story, I tell him "put it in the secret Part 2". The secret part 2 is a bunch of chapters along the lines of "Imagine this tight end-to-end story but with this cool additional feature!". And so I think we also need a section of each blog post that's like a secret part II. 

Project idea: I want to have tag for markdown where i can view two authors in different fonts

*[Jarred 6.30am the next day] 👆️ This is in fact the whole project.*

**A brief aside on toddlers and aeroplanes**

Sophie recently shared some very wise advice a prolific mathematician gave her.

"Imagine you were teleported into a 747 jet areoplane and you must now fly it. You might imagine you start quite carefully testing things out, especially with the big blaring red things. Imagine now the same thing situation occurs to a small child. You might imagine they would just pressing every button and pulling every lever, especially the big red ones. If you want to do good math research, be more like the toddler."

- - -

*[ Jarred 6pm ]* Ok, I'm done. The post is a bit manic but I think that's ok. Are you ok to publish it?

*[ Sophie 6pm ]* Leave it with me 👍️

**exerpts from a voice note from a night walk**

"I did not send out the blog post on purpose. Because I have followed the spirit of aliveness and it has led me here."

"I just I looked within myself and I discovered that I do not care about the part about the writing of the blog posts, even the research logs."

"If it's not something I'm willing to die for, then it should feel like driving a bus."

"I feel so proud of myself for saying I would do something and then not."

"Learning what you actually did [today], and like, maybe trying to add something myself. That's the skill that I want to build this month."

"Maybe we ship something every work day in December, except for Fridays where we circle or something? I think if it continues to be this full-frontal I might need something like that."

"I want to build some muscle... around going from an idea to having shipped a thing... that's something I'm quite looking for... I have a theory that would be good for me... like learning how to clean a new kitchen"

- - -

*[Jarred 6.30am the following day]*

**a thought I had this morning**

*I think we could embed exerpts from this voice note in the post, ship it all as the first day's research output, and then admit our failure-to-ship according to day 1's rules to Harri and hope he has it in him to be egregiously disapointed in us despite how much he loves us. I think that could work well actually.*
