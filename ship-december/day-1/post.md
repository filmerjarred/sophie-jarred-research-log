### some preamble

*The kingdom of heaven is that sometimes we can generate order and that we can accept and extend grace.*

[ Sophie 4pm ] I don't get this

[ Jarred 4pm ] I have a weakness for starting essays with a cryptic bit of poetry which sort of underlies the whole thing

[ Sophie 4pm ] What does it mean?

[ Jarred 4pm ] It's like... the place for humanity that I belive is possible that I have hope in... it's possible because we have this faculty for recognising and generating clarity and order. Like our external world can in fact improve, we can improve it and make it kinder to inhabit. Some Christians I know might call this rightousness. But a capacity and sense for rightousness tends to react with the human prepensity for shame and collapse. If you create a kind between actions or a way of being (rightousness) and outcomes then it can stand to reason that bad outcomes, mess, etc can be attributed to character flaw, which then creates more problems. So there's this balance like... you need recognition and striving for order and you also need constant infusions of grace for one's self and for others... anyway

[ Sophie 2pm ] I'm nervous that I feel like I can't write in a post.

[ Jarred 7am ]

Sophie and I have a harebrained research scheme inspired by Inkhaven to ship a working piece of software every workday in the month of December. I’m toying with calling it Ship December but she has yet to sign off. “December” would be a formidable name for a ship I think.

It's 6.30am for me in Hamilton Canada. Sophie is asleep as for her it's currently 3.30am in Berkley.

As far as a shared plan goes, all we have at this time is some text messages saying “let’s do it.”

Some questions which reasonably present themselves at this juncture:

* What counts as having successfully shipped?

* What happens if we fail to ship?

* Is it okay that I (Jarred) have already written a minor essay about bones (below) in which I use a lot of “I” statements and not “We” statements?

* Is it okay that I’ve already written a caffinated provisional plan in which we ship a webpage which records a message to a google doc?

Hopefully Sophie can answer these and more when she wakes up.

### FAQ (where F = 1)

[ Sophie 12pm ]

I am awake\!

Q: What counts as shipped?  
A: First we say some words about an idea. Then later we can click some buttons on our phones and/or laptops and then a reliably cool thing related happens on the screen. The cool thing needs to be available over the public internet.

Q: What happens if we fail to ship?  
A: If we miss one day, then we admit our failure to Harri and he is egregiously disappointed in us. Or we aren't allowed to wear a coat the next day. If we miss two days in a row, then the project is over.

Q: Is it okay that I (Jarred) have already written a minor essay about bones (below) in which I use a lot of “I” statements and not “We” statements?  
A: This question is in fact the whole project.

Q: Is it okay that I’ve already written a provisional plan in which we ship a webpage which records a message to a google doc?  
A: :O YES. Can I see?\!?

```
[ Jarred 9am ]
Ok. Here is a potential plan for today.

We could make a webpage which implements a simple design pattern. The design pattern is this:

1. I have a thought, the structure and content of which I would like to remember later

2. I tap a button or icon on my phone (which is for better or worse almost always to hand)

3. I speak my thought at my phone

4. This is sufficient to have words reflecting my speech end up in a more durable form than my memory, say in a google doc.
```

### What did we ship today?

[ Sophie 5pm ]

tldr; we shipped our website and our first research post

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filmerjarred/sophie-jarred-research-log/main/ship-december/day-1/image.png)

 We both got excited about this and decided to piviot from the original plan involving a recording a message (maybe we will do this tomorrow).

We shipped a minimum viable version of the following system:

1. There is a git-repo with a folder named `ship-dec` and sub folders from `/day-1` to `/day-31`

2. If we commit a markdown file called `post.md` to `/ship-december/day-1` then it will be available for viewing at [sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-1](https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-1)

### some thoughts on the gnawing of one’s bone

[ Jarred 7am ]

I have a bone that I would like to gnaw. It's about penetration into deep knots… it's about progress. 

My bone is about confusion, that’s true. It's about coherence. It's about "*what do you mean by that?*" and what it's like to say and hear that sentence many times in one conversation.

My bone is about deeply tangled whispers I think. Some asides and definitions on all this to follow.

\---

Something is tangled when it must move freely yet it cannot because there’s too much of itself too close together.

\---

Years ago I told John Salvatier: "*I very often feel like I've left the oven on*".

John resonated with this quite deeply. This was quite an important occasion to us both. Lately I've been referring to this feeling as "the whispers".

The most recent case of whispers I can recall I got while reading an EA x Buddhism [memoir](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09FFQSMLK?ref=KC_GS_GB_CA). It brought back the original ideas, mindset, and feelings I had when discovering EA. I overheard various ovens in me which have been left in an on position ever since.

\---

Annie Dillard in “The Writing Life” introduced me to this phrase: “*gnaw your own bone*.” It’s been on my mind recently. Here is the quote.

*There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain.  It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; ...give voice to this, your own astonishment.* 

*“The most demanding part of living a lifetime as an artist is the strict discipline of forcing oneself to work steadfastly along the nerve of one’s own most intimate sensitivity.” Anne Truitt, the sculptor, said this.* 

*Thoreau said it another way: know your own bone. “Pursue, keep up with, circle round and round your life…. Know your own bone: gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw at it still.”*

I don’t know if I have the discipline or the finesse to work steadfastly along the nerve of my most intimate sensitivity. Gnawing at a bone is more inelegant and seems more achievable.

\---

Last Friday I spent several hours writing at my kitchen table. I got up to chop broccoli. It would be cool if I could say aloud to something "*read that back to me*" and hear what I wrote through my headphones. It would be cool if I could pause and play and rewind and make edits with my voice while I cook.

It would be cool if I could say aloud "I feel worse today, I wonder perhaps it was the beans or the large portion size” and it would go in the spreadsheet where it needs to live.

Part of what's going on with whispers is that I remember I had relevant thoughts about a subject that I've never seen written down but I don't remember what they were or in what context I had them.

### A brief aside on togglers and aeroplanes

[ Jarred 6pm ]

Surley this is much too long. My apologies.

A couple of times this afternoon I've been a bit on auto pilot with this Ship December project. This is perhaps not a good sign for the first day. When I remember this "gnawing ones bone" thing I perk back up. I'm excited by the opportunity to spend a month gnawing whatever bone this is.

Sophie told me something a very wise matehmetician said to her.

"Imagine you were teleported into a 747 jet areoplane and you had to fly it straight away. One might imagine you would be quite careful, especially with the blaring red buttons. Imagine the same thing happens to a toddler. You might imagine they would just pressing every button, especially the big red ones. If you want to do math research, be more like the baby."

I'm excited to "just start" trying to build a thrown together system for Sophie and I to collaborate where we experiment a bunch and see what happens.
