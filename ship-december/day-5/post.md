[ Jarred 9.30am ]

Ah, right.

The way the side-bar is at the moment we can't add day-5 unless we edit day-4.

This whole code-base could really use a tidy. It's become a bit tangled.

There are a number of tangles going on with this project.

# on assorted genres of dread which may or may not be outside my window

1. When developing software, the work to un-cut corners grows non-linearly with each additional temporary hack. There comes a point in every rapidly prototyped project where the ability to add new features starts to slow down and time spent working around the consequences of quick-fixes grows.

A surprising amount of human moral machinery gets repurposed in programming I think. When I'm not keeping a codebase "clean" there's a subtle self-disgust that starts to mount, as though I'm failing to take full care of my physical health via hygiene.

I've noticed that AI-coding both expands the window of play before walls start to get hit, and also rams me into them sooner and harder.

2. There's a related dread when building prototypes which I think often masquerades as cutting-corners-shame-dread but is in fact something deeper that's actually more ot do with the tension between the exciting dream and the reality. It's more akin to getting excited about a date, an apartment, a holiday, or a new expensive kitchen appliance and then managing deflation on account of unmet hopes or additional unexpected difficulty.

There's less of this genre of dread here with this project than I might have expected. Some reasons this might be:

- Because I'm working on it full time I can afford to keep "returning to the bone" / regenerating the source of my inspiration. There's enough time to complete full inspiration -> experiment -> mild deflation -> orienting -> inspiration loops. Maybe more practically speaking "there's enough time spare to put my headphones on and sit in my kitchen and write in order to re-contact a feeling that these experiments are worthwhile on their own terms.

- It's actually a cool project with many interesting directions

- Something about "working in public" and or the research log. Normally when I'm doing research most of the interesting work is in the orienting before and after experiments. Generally this is just stored away a md file on my computer. There's something very nice about sharing it as I go and I think it takes a lot of the pressure off the results of the experiments themselves having to fully justify the time spent.

**some thoughts on things my friend Harri has said to me**

Harri once told me a story I felt was relevant.

He was in change of interviewing elite impressive young people for EA grants.

In the course of the interviews a sense of confusion might arise in Harri, and (because he's a jedi) he would ask the dumb obvious question posed by his confusion.

The interviewee would answer quickly, confidently, and maybe dismissively. Harri was still confused though so he would ask again or ask the question posed by their response. This back and forth would sometimes play out over a long period where Harri would just keep asking the dumb obvious question, and eventually they'd get to a point where the interviewee was like "Oh... well yeah I guess we haven't thought of that" or something.

I think about this a lot.

Last year Harri spent a great deal of time thinking about Effective Altruism and what about it compelled him to give his twenties to it which still seems worthwhile in retrospect (my words).

In my memory, he repeated often with great strain something like 

"well... so there's truth"
"yes"
"the truth is quite good"
"yes"
"and also... good"
"yes"
"good is also very good"
"yes, famously"
"and the thing is when you have... people"
"yes"
"and they're together" and he might have held both his hands up to indicate two different people
"yes"
"when they care about the truth and also the good" and he sort of gestured at the space between his hands representing two different people
"and truth and good and the truth about the good and the good about the truth can exist and move between them"
"yes"
"well that's quite good"
"yes"
"and when there's a lot of that going on"
"yes"
"well that's really good"

I think the actual sentence he repeated was "a lively epistemic forum" but the above dialogue is how it exists in my mind and also might have actually happened at least in part.

According to me this also rhymes with what Anna reported in her experience of early EA. I think the word she used was "earnest". An unusual concentration of earnestness regarding the world and what a good world might look like.

Something else Harri would say to me often and still does: "Build me Lesswrong for postrats" or "Build me a post-rat forum"!

I've thought about that often this week. Often this month actually.

There was something really gratifying about reading Harri's Inkhaven post each day.

A lively epistemic forum.

Earnestness.

Hmmmm.

Once Harri commanded me to build him a post-rat less wrong and I said "that's what twitter is" and he said "I want twitter but it's only you and me on it."

We tried sharing a google doc where we would write one another little essays and that was quite fun.

It's quite fun and often surprisingly productive to write for friends.

Sometimes at LARC we talk about "a society of letters" and everyone says "mmmm".
