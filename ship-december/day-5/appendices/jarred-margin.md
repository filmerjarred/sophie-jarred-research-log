a. slowly attempting to orieint to my life, reality, and the world such that I'm inspired to undertake an experiment, or what sophie would call "a totally normal epic adventure

b. slowly attempting to orient after having vibrated my situatedness to pieces on account of undertaking said experiment.

In sober terms, this process recently looks like my 
1. waking up in some kind of cramped and or impotent mood
2. meditating, stretching, and slowly pacing while i slowly load up the context of my life
3. end up writing in my notebook and then arrive at something like "spending 3 hours adding an AI librarian experiment to the research log would be cool, fun on it's own terms, and give me data for my orienting process
4. i go do that
5. (most of the time) it's not so obviously fruitful that it makes me *more* oriented
6.

"Please add the following feature to the vscode-extension"

"Add a command which will encrypt and decrypt the contents of a card. It will take all the text (except the user) in the card where the cursor is and encrypt it with a password that's set in the .env. If there is no password set in the .env then it will request one and set it."

"It will take something like the following card:
```
[ Jarred 10.am ]

This is my message
```

and turn it into

```
[ Jarred 10.am ]
[Encrypted]

asfdhunjndfgdfsg
```

and if encryption is toggled again it will look like

```
[ Unencrypted ]
[ Jarred 10.am ]

This is my message
```

and then we add a git commit to do a quick scan for cards with [ Unencrypted ] and we refuse to push then and tell the user to either remove it or encrypt it before pushing."


On the front-end, there should be a script that detects if a card is encrypted when it's rendering the page in the browser. If it's encrypted, don't show the encrypted text; instead, just display the user and a decrypt button. Then, ask for that user's password and add a checkbox that's like "Save this password" and "Automatically decrypt in the future" into local storage, which will just be like the username-password.

Can you have the voice comments rather than be in circles? Just be interleaved with the text comments. With the play button to play the audio, and also a play button on the comments that are just text comments which will generate audio and play them.
