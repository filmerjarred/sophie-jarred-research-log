<p>[Jarred 9am]</p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>It&#39;s Day 2 of Ship December.</p>
<p>I was eating breakfast just now and wondering to myself the obvious question.</p>
<p>&quot;What to ship today?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a great relief to have this question find me without any effort on my behalf, rather than my having to go hunting for a sense of urgency about the day. On the downside I did wake up for an hour or so at 2am last night stressed about what we might ship today. Anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;What to ship today?&quot;</p>
<p>I pondered this for a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;I could add a side-bar with the different days to the research log?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could do some finagling such that there&#39;s a margin with all our scratch notes beside the log? And you could text a telegram channel to add to it.&quot;</p>
<p>None of it felt quite right, so I asked &quot;what was that bone I wanted to gnaw this month?&quot;</p>
<p>The thought then occurred to me, <em>it would be cool if I could say &quot;please read aloud the segment from yesterday&#39;s research log about gnawing bones&quot;</em> and an AI would repeat it to me. So we&#39;re going to do that!</p>
<p>If there&#39;s time I might riff a little more on why this feels relevant, but my prudence is suggesting I get shipping out of the way first, as if we fail to ship today the project is sunk and that would be very sad.</p>
<p>I need a song to play this section out.</p>

<p>[ Jarred 10am ]</p>
<p>Ok!</p>
<p>We have an AI librarian up and running at at <a href="https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-2/talk-to-the-log">/talk-to-the-log</a>.</p>
<p>It lacks the polish to be useful just yet I think, but it does work.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can embed it here live... I&#39;ll add a screenshot and a button which should load the demo up.</p>
<div id="embed-container">
  <div id="iframe-view" style="display: none;">
    <button onclick="showScreenshot()" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 8px 16px; cursor: pointer; background: #666; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px;">← Back to screenshot</button>
    <br>
    <iframe id="live-embed" src="" width="100%" height="600" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="screenshot-view">
    <button onclick="showEmbed()" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 8px 16px; cursor: pointer; background: #4a9eff; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px;">Try it live ▶</button>
    <br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filmerjarred/sophie-jarred-research-log/main/ship-december/day-2/image.png" alt="screenshot of talk-to-the-log" style="max-width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">
  </div>
</div>

<script>
function showEmbed() {
  document.getElementById('screenshot-view').style.display = 'none';
  document.getElementById('iframe-view').style.display = 'block';
  // Forward API key from parent URL to iframe
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const keyParam = params.get('k');
  const iframeSrc = 'https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-2/talk-to-the-log' + (keyParam ? '?k=' + encodeURIComponent(keyParam) : '');
  document.getElementById('live-embed').src = iframeSrc;
}
function showScreenshot() {
  document.getElementById('iframe-view').style.display = 'none';
  document.getElementById('screenshot-view').style.display = 'block';
  document.getElementById('live-embed').src = '';
}
</script>

<p>Am I shipped for today? Am I done?</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;d just need to email this post to our audience.</p>
<p>It feels a little cheap somehow... the thing that&#39;s been shipped isn&#39;t proper yet.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s sort of worse that it &quot;looks like&quot; it could be useful I think.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a very pernicious feeling when I&#39;m interacting with a product that looks like it should work / should be useful but there are dumb things obviously wrong with it</p>
<p>It is however lunch time, and I&#39;m starving.</p>
<p>okokokok, by the spirit of the rules I say we have shipped, and this afternoon we&#39;ll see about shipping something that actually feels satisfying.</p>
<hr>
<p>[ Jarred 3pm ]</p>
<p>Right, we&#39;re back.</p>
<p>There was an issue with the voice cutting in and out and cracking. That&#39;s fixed in <a href="https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-2/talk-to-the-log-2">/talk-to-the-log-2</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>[ Jarred 4pm]</p>
<p>I might try to give it something so that I can save notes to self, and then see what it&#39;s like to chat with it while I make dinner... oh! And maybe also a tool to put words up on the screen?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>please copy talk-to-the-log-2 to talk-to-the-log-3. also i just made a file firebase.js and dumped a
firestore api key in there, can you flesh that out to make a simple &quot;save and retrieve note&quot; function (just saves a text note to the firestore collection). the database permissions are open for testing don&#39;t worry about auth for now that api key should work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ok now let&#39;s add two tools to the realtime voice agent in talk-to-the-log-3. one tool to save a note as dictated by the user to the firebase. and another tool which will display some text (usually parts of the research log) on the screen in a relatively fullscreen modal using cardo font.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[ Jarred 5pm ]</p>
<p>It works! <a href="https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-2/talk-to-the-log-3">/talk-to-the-log-3</a>.</p>
<p>I used it while cooking dinner to pull up relevant sections of yesterday&#39;s log and makes notes. Took a bit to get into and it can be jank, but it was fun.</p>
