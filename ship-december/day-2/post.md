[Jarred 9am]

Good morning!

It's Day 2 of Ship December.

I was eating breakfast just now and wondering to myself the obvious question.

"What to ship today?"

It's a great relief to have this question be obvious and for it to come to me, rather than my having to go fetch it. On the downside I did wake up at 2am last night for around an hour with this question on my mind. Anyway.

"What to ship today?"

I pondered this for a bit.

"I could add a side-bar with the different days to the research log?"

"I could do some fanaling such that there's a margin with all our scratch notes beside the log? And you could text a telegram channel to add to it."

None of it felt quite right, so I asked "what was that bone I wanted to gnaw this month?"

The thought then occurred to me, *it would be cool if I could say "please read aloud the segment from yesterday's research log about gnawing bones"* and an AI would repeat it to me. So we're going to do that!

If there's time I might riff a little more on why this feels relevant, but my prudence is suggesting I get shipping out of the way first, as if we fail to ship today the project is sunk and that would be very sad.

I need a song to play this section out.

Ok!

We have an AI librarian at [/talk-to-the-log](https://sophie-jarred.researchlog.dev/ship-december/day-2/talk-to-the-log).

It lacks the polish to be useful I think, but it does work.

I wonder if I can embed it here...

<div id="embed-container">
