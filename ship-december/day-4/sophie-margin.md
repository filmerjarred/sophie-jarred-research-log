8:50 last night
    Some things that feel exciting to me:
        1. Make any tool in patchwork. I feel excited about voice notes in patchwork 
        2. An idea that I have about a markdown viewing extension that’s like toggling but not indented and you don’t need headers. Sort of like my “short abstract” idea for the forest 
        3. an addition to the topos forest extension. I have lots of notes from when I was live foresting in Edinburgh
        4. the mvp for our own version of the forest??!


10:42 let's orient more broadly

    we need to pay the bills

    "I see how this research project might actually be related to paying the bills"

        especially after that call with Peter

    "cutting loose and following the spirit of aliveness and wholeness preserving transformations"

        what a blessing

        "the blessing of depression"

            > I also don’t feel shame. Would it not be more insincere to write something substantial under the guise of intrinsic motivation? I think so.
        
        what would it be like to go for the jugular while depressed?

    thought experiment
        Jarred starts working on the experiment "everything is a card"
        Sophie starts working on building forester from scratch
    Jarred has blanket permission to send quotes that sophie said and quotes from sophie-margin to our list of subscribers

    we're two people
        
        we have jobs
        we're at work
        jobs are important because they help to pay the bills
        we're something like "ambitious" 
        but that word is obviously dead to us
        
        we have bones
        that we have been gnawing for some time

        these bones are often at a distance

        we set aside a month to do the brave thing
        to do try to get into it
        to go for the jugular

        and we made a container for that
        that's pretty cool

        we're cozying up to whether having jobs and having bones could be the same thing

        sophie is a little bit depressed

        we're looking for a way to gear in
        we're looking for a way to make our bones public

        we're radically working in public    

    schedule a meeting with brendan

        about this research project
        about topos and sgai and paying the bills
        ? about more funding for jarred through sgai

    we're nascently exploring a new funding avenue for topos in the vein of "tools for thought"
    
    things we could do now that are occuring to jarred: 

        sophie formatting thing
        add to sophie's system 3
        system 3 extension

        start ideating about forester replacement


11:14 let's get an MVP of 

    What is the minimum viable forester do?
        
        Plain text + ordinary latex -> HTML
        
        I'm in a markdown file in VScode and when I hit a hotkey it "zooms in" and I see that line and everything indented underneath it

        make a little window that i embed in the post that i write typst in and it compiles to html
            Muck around with typst


    Big brain idea
        It's like roam research
        where when you're editing (or reading)
        you can see (via toggling) everything "underneath" what you're writing
        And also you can click into "lower things" to exclude the larger thing

        I want to write in some files some text and some latex
        And I want those files to become blocks 

        I want transclusions to be actual transclusions

        blocks do not need to be transcluded into multiple places
        it can be like a big file with indentations
        BUT you should be able to "zoom in"

    Jarred: The quickest path towards winning in my heart: 
        opening codex
        and saying "in build.js under day 3 I wanna make it such that any text between two dashes is in a different font"

    "it's very typical"
        to have a sense of something obvious and exciting
        and unfortunately you have to start from the start
        and exploring a bunch of different avenues and failing immediately

        especially "I could try out the brand new hot thing that the kids are using
        and it's dumb and it doesn't work but maybe it's me"
        that's very typical
