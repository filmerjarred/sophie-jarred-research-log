What do I mean by in the sea?

Well, I'm in the sea when my inner world is tangled in some way and it feels not-nice. Perhaps specifically when the not-nice feeling isn't clearly attributable to a cause that I can resolve.

This feels related to some other terms my friends use. "My face is in the soup" and "my head is in a burlap sack".

I just wrote two paragraphs trying to explain IFS self whilst eating breakfast at the same time and now the waves are a little more boisterous.

I put a lot of salt on my broccoli and my mouth tastes like the ocean and I can feel kitchen-floor-debris stuck to my feet.

Let's see if I can wash this plate in a cosy way, put some milk in my tea, and then sweep the floor.

This apartment has no broom nor dustpan. Only a vacuum cleaner.

Ok, that's better than it was.

I have socks on now.

Where was I?

I'm a little bit in the sea, and I have a mind to get warmer and or a bit more dry.

1. Sophie and being a good collaborator

2. Cards!?!?!?
3. A whole bunch of notes I gave to the librarian the other day about verbal whiteboards and verbal zettelkasten
4. Shipping
4. "That sidebar really need to be thinner"
4. I put a whole bunch of small todos around here somewhere
3. I need to send that invoice
a. that Henrik Karlsson post

I was reading a Henrik Karlsson post this morning. It was on Idris Murdoc's essay's "The Sovereignty of the good over other concepts".

Sophie once told me "Whenever I try to read a Henrik Karlsson post I can only get a couple sentences in before I have to stop. It's all too relevant and it makes me nauseous".

It would be cool if I had a big history of our voice notes and I could insert the audio snippet easily.

This morning I was reading the essay, and I experimented with Chrome's new "Reading Mode" which is quite cool actually. It resonates with this project.

I got up to chop broccoli and transitioned to having chrome read the text aloud.

I got to the part of the post where Henrik is relating the actual content of the philosophy and my working memory hit a sharp wall. There was a desire for the affordance to pause (via my headphone media controls or via speaking), to go back a couple sentences, to start indexing and actively metabolising what's been said by breaking it up into pieces and paraphrasing it.

One angle on my bone is: "how it would feel to have a magic stack of index cards"

These magic index cards are floating nearby at all times, or maybe live in my pocket, and just as I might move my hand I can will them out and into view.

I could fan them out in their thousands or tens out in front of me. Maybe I could lay on the floor and tile my ceiling with them.

There's a way it feels to be in a meeting and have a blank piece of paper and a pen vs not.

In my dream I'm standing chopping broccoli, there is a floating index card with Henrik's post on it in the corner of my vision, and the text is being read aloud.

In my dream with a minor flick of my will I can play/pause or rewind. I can summon blank cards at will. I can say "ok, in simple sentances so what's been said so far is..."

There's this great Wait but Why post about how he writes such great explainers. He talks about how he "builds the tree". That is, "If you want to explain something complex to someone you need to go right back to the basic and the obvious and build up a tree of context, most of which they already know."

"If you want to explain something complex to someone most of the communication will be reminding them of things they already know."

"Ok, so remember the whole situation with A, B, C, D, E, F, and of course G?"
"Ok, well turns out H and probably also I"
"🤯"

One difficulty with things is that it's very rare for people to do this, and instead I must either ignore all the leaves or undertake the laborious process of building out the tree myself.

One angle on my bone is that I want a system which helps me with this.

I come across a golden leaf in an Idris Murdoch quote that's painful to just throw away but also there's no tree to put it on and it's somehow both very heavy and very fragile and I also need my hands to chop broccoli and buy a dustpan on amazon (whoops).

I'm a little embarrassed that I shelled out for the one with the bamboo handle.

Where was I? It was quite good.

Oh yeah. I want a system which helps me find a place for tree-less leaves I encounter.

All that relevance I encounter lacking context and or affordance.

In my dream I'd be able to make a room in my mind palace, and dedicate that room to the process of metabolising the leaves of this Henrik post, and the Idris quotes within it.

*(It's 9.20am, I need to start looking to ship soon. We could make easy access to the librarian? We could add a cards based comment system?)*

In my dream I'd be able to make a room in my mind palace for these leaves and the metabolism thereof. It'd take them as they are delivered and find an appropriate system of pedestals.

"The main thrust of her argument is A, B, and C"

There's a worry here that you might think the room is for storing facts like memorising for an exam. That's less a dream and more a nightmare.

It's closer to making someone else's thoughts a part of me?

Seeing what someone else has seen and who they were when they saw it?

There's a whole rabbithole here about learning as "seeing someone else's seeing" vs "seeing what someone saw"... hold on maybe this wants a diagram.

*In the process of drawing this diagram I have come to feel that this is tangent was deeply misguided and perhaps even dumb*

I'm in the sea a bit.

I'm trying to get dry by making space between things.

One genre of things is my noticing little pings relevant to the bone I have a mind to gnaw this month.

There's something itchy and disorienting about a train of thought that goes:

1. *looks at our research log*
2. *notice day-3 is hard to read on account of the sidebar width*
3. *desire to intervene on that but it feels tense*
4. *a sense this could be relieved by re-focusing on the-bone*
5. *start journalling in the research log in an attempt to "work steadfastly along the nerve of one’s own most intimate sensitivity"*
6. *follow a gestalt down a rabbithole*
7. *feel shame about verbalising my stream of though without regard for whether it's coherent or I've given enough trunk for the leaves I'm putting out*
8. *some sense that actually working with these "leaves" / "soap bubbles of relevance" as they float up to the surface of my pond is relevant to the research somehow*

at this juncture sometimes the train derails with the thought "chasing these bubbles is just a distraction from things you don't want to feel". 

9. *start thinking about the magic index-card dream, feel this is a good way-in*
10. *try to differentiate magic index cards from a list of facts*

My Grandad used to work at the museum. His job was to field phone requests for facts which were kept in an enormous index of... well index cards.

It's all scratch space if you increase the scale.

A notebook is scratch space at the scale of me in a meeting.

An encyclopedia is scratch space at the scale of... humanity? This generation of westerners?

In a past life I spent years designing a very complex software system.

There were a handful of ways-of-seeing-the-whole.

It taught me a lot about the roots of a system.

I'm mixing tree metaphors, are these the same?

All complex systems have deep generators. The system is made of a system of patterns and some of those patterns are very deep. They recede down and out of sight.

How to say...

"A pattern is deep to the degree that it predicts the behaviour of the system...

"The deeper the pattern the more it will predict the behaviour of other patterns?"
"The deeper the pattern the more it influences? informs? the behaviour of other patterns"
"The more it is re-used by other patterns"

"The deeper the pattern the more of a non-linear increase in ability to predict the system."

I go back every year or two to visit. My old boss will complain "the people working on it now, they don't get the deeper patterns, they don't get what it *is*"

I'm sitting at my kitchen counter chopping broccoli imagining magic index cards because I'm trying to get at the deeper generator of the leaves. The actual bar I want to clear.

There is *something* pinging at the bottom of this lake. There is *something* irritating my ears. Maybe it's a time bomb, maybe it's a transponder in a treasure chest, maybe I'm dreaming and actually my smoke alarm is out of battery.

Something is pinging me, and letting my attention drift is one strategy for getting at it.

Maybe I should go back to the leaf thing, that felt good.

---

I want a system for helping me to build out branches and trunks beneath things I encounter where I don't yet know what it means.

"What do you mean by that Idris? What do you think Heinrik?"

Ah, right I got distracted playing around with the "mind palace" metaphor. 

That's right, I was trying to ask what the purpose of the room in the mind palace was.

In this stream of text the "leaves" are this post I encountered this morning and noticing tools I think I want in order to interact with this post.

The wood and trunk are me asking what those tools are and what deeper purposes they might serve. I'm trying to generate context and affordance.

Ok so how would this comment system work
