Being in-the-sea feels related to some other terms my friends use. 

"My face is in the soup" and "my head is in a burlap sack".

I just wrote two paragraphs trying to explain IFS self whilst eating breakfast at the same time and now the waves are a little more boisterous.

I put a lot of salt on my broccoli and my mouth tastes like the ocean and I can feel kitchen-floor-debris stuck to my feet.

Let's see if I can wash this plate in a cosy way, put some milk in my tea, and then sweep the floor.

---

This apartment has no broom nor dustpan. Only a vacuum cleaner.

Ok, that's better than it was.

I have socks on to deal with a dirty floor.

Where was I?

I'm a little bit in the sea, and I have a mind to get warmer and or a bit more dry.

What's in the froth?

1. Sophie and whether I'm being a good collaborator
2. Cards!?!?!?
3. A whole bunch of notes I gave to the librarian the other day about verbal whiteboards and verbal zettelkasten
4. Shipping
4. "That sidebar really need to be thinner"
4. I put a whole bunch of small todos around here somewhere
3. I need to send that invoice
a. that Henrik Karlsson post

---

I was reading a Henrik Karlsson post this morning. It was on Idris Murdoc's essay's "The Sovereignty of the good over other concepts".

Sophie once told me "Whenever I try to read a Henrik Karlsson post I can only get a couple sentences in before I have to stop. It's all too relevant and it makes me nauseous".

It would be cool if I had a big history of our voice notes and I could insert the audio snippet easily.

This morning I was reading the essay, and I experimented with Chrome's new "Reading Mode" which is quite cool actually. It resonates with this project.

I got up to chop broccoli and transitioned to having chrome read the text aloud.

I got to the part of the post where Henrik is relating the actual content of the philosophy and my working memory hit a sharp wall. There was a desire for the affordance to pause (via my headphone media controls or via speaking), to go back a couple sentences, to start indexing and actively metabolising what's been said by breaking it up into pieces and paraphrasing it.

One angle on my bone is: "how it would feel to have a magic stack of index cards"

These magic index cards are floating nearby at all times, or maybe live in my pocket, and just as I might move my hand I can will them out and into view.

I could fan them out in their thousands or tens out in front of me. Maybe I could lay on the floor and tile my ceiling with them.

There's a way it feels to be in a meeting and have a blank piece of paper and a pen vs not.

In my dream I'm standing chopping broccoli, there is a floating index card with Henrik's post on it in the corner of my vision, and the text is being read aloud.

In my dream with a minor flick of my will I can play/pause or rewind. I can summon blank cards at will. I can say "ok, in simple sentances so what's been said so far is..."

There's this great Wait but Why post about how he writes such great explainers. He talks about how he "builds the tree". That is, "If you want to explain something complex to someone you need to go right back to the basic and the obvious and build up a tree of context, most of which they already know."

"If you want to explain something complex to someone most of the communication will be reminding them of things they already know."

"Ok, so remember the whole situation with A, B, C, D, E, F, and of course G?"
"Ok, well turns out H and probably also I"
"🤯"

One difficulty with things is that it's very rare for people to do this, and instead I must either ignore all the leaves or undertake the laborious process of building out the tree myself.

One angle on my bone is that I want a system which helps me with this.

I come across a golden leaf in an Idris Murdoch quote that's painful to just throw away but also there's no tree to put it on and it's somehow both very heavy and very fragile and I also need my hands to chop broccoli and buy a dustpan on amazon (whoops, I forgot).

![alt text](../image-13.png)

I'm a little embarrassed that I shelled out for the one with the bamboo handle.

Where was I? It was quite good.

Oh yeah. I want a system which helps me find a place for tree-less leaves I encounter.

All that relevance I encounter lacking context and or affordance.

In my dream I'd be able to make a room in my mind palace, and dedicate that room to the process of metabolising the leaves of this Henrik post, and the Idris quotes within it.

*(It's 9.20am, I need to start looking to ship soon. We could make easy access to the librarian? We could add a cards based comment system?)*

In my dream I'd be able to make a room in my mind palace for these leaves and the metabolism thereof. It'd take them as they are delivered and find an appropriate system of pedestals.

"The main thrust of her argument is A, B, and C"

There's a worry here that you might think the room is for storing facts like memorising for an exam. That's less a dream and more a nightmare.

It's closer to making someone else's thoughts a part of me?

Seeing what someone else has seen and who they were when they saw it?

There's a whole rabbithole here about learning as "seeing someone else's seeing" vs "seeing what someone saw"... hold on maybe this wants a diagram.

![alt text](image-14.png)

*In the process of drawing this diagram I have come to feel that this is tangent was deeply misguided and perhaps even dumb*

I'm in the sea a bit.

I'm trying to get dry by making space between things.

One genre of things is my noticing little pings relevant to the bone I have a mind to gnaw this month.

There's something itchy and disorienting about a train of thought that goes:

1. *looks at our research log*
2. *notice day-3 is hard to read on account of the sidebar width*
3. *desire to intervene on that but it feels tense*
4. *a sense this could be relieved by re-focusing on the-bone*
5. *start journalling in the research log in an attempt to "work steadfastly along the nerve of one’s own most intimate sensitivity"*
6. *follow a gestalt down a rabbithole*
7. *feel shame about verbalising my stream of though without regard for whether it's coherent or I've given enough trunk for the leaves I'm putting out*
8. *some sense that actually working with these "leaves" / "soap bubbles of relevance" as they float up to the surface of my pond is relevant to the research somehow*

at this juncture sometimes the train derails with the thought "chasing these bubbles is just a distraction from things you don't want to feel". 

9. *start thinking about the magic index-card dream, feel this is a good way-in*
10. *try to differentiate magic index cards from a list of facts*

My Grandad used to work at the museum. His job was to field phone requests for facts which were kept in an enormous index of... well index cards.

It's all scratch space if you increase the scale.

A notebook is scratch space at the scale of me in a meeting.

An encyclopedia is scratch space at the scale of... humanity? This generation of westerners?

In a past life I spent years designing a very complex software system.

There were a handful of ways-of-seeing-the-whole.

It taught me a lot about the roots of a system.

I'm mixing tree metaphors, are these the same?

All complex systems have deep generators. The system is made of a system of patterns and some of those patterns are very deep. They recede down and out of sight.

How to say...

"A pattern is deep to the degree that it predicts the behaviour of the system...

"The deeper the pattern the more it will predict the behaviour of other patterns?"
"The deeper the pattern the more it influences? informs? the behaviour of other patterns"
"The more it is re-used by other patterns"

"The deeper the pattern the more of a non-linear increase in ability to predict the system."

I go back every year or two to visit. My old boss will complain "the people working on it now, they don't get the deeper patterns, they don't get what it *is*"

I'm sitting at my kitchen counter chopping broccoli imagining magic index cards because I'm trying to get at the deeper generator of the leaves. The actual bar I want to clear.

There is *something* pinging at the bottom of this lake. There is *something* irritating my ears. Maybe it's a time bomb, maybe it's a transponder in a treasure chest, maybe I'm dreaming and actually my smoke alarm is out of battery.

Something is pinging me, and letting my attention drift is one strategy for getting at it.

Maybe I should go back to the leaf thing, that felt good.

---

I want a system for helping me to build out branches and trunks beneath things I encounter where I don't yet know what it means.

"What do you mean by that Idris? What do you think Heinrik?"

Ah, right I got distracted playing around with the "mind palace" metaphor. 

That's right, I was trying to ask what the purpose of the room in the mind palace was.

In this stream of text the "leaves" are this post I encountered this morning and noticing tools I think I want in order to interact with this post.

The wood and trunk are me asking what those tools are and what deeper purposes they might serve. I'm trying to generate context and affordance.

Ok so how would this comment system work


---

*[ Jarred 11.30am ]*

Ok where are we now?

- that idris post
- a comment system
- those notes i relayed to the librarian the other day. let's fetch those.

Verbal notes from Dec 2nd:

   - Dec 2nd 16:10 "Test note created for functionality check."

   - Dec 2nd 16:33 "The 'bone' is about wanting to interact with ideas in a fluid, natural way—capturing thoughts effortlessly, like speaking aloud while cooking and having ideas saved or read back. It’s about untangling the messiness of remembering thoughts and making it easier to capture small personal insights in real time."

   - Dec 2nd 16:34 "The tree manager: going back to that LLM tree manager and having headings and a mental topology of the..."

   - Dec 2nd 16:35 "I find context management on my mind. Like how much is this costing? Has the research log tool been called multiple times? Some kind of context GUI would be good."

   - Dec 2nd 16:37 "There is something interesting in the notion of the verbal whiteboard—a way to manage thoughts and context in real time."

   - Dec 2nd 16:38 "There should also be a search tool that can search through all the research notes, not just pull up day one or day two. For example, if I want to say, "Tell me the story about the plane and the toddler," it should be able to find it."

   - Dec 2nd 16:39 "Pulling up cards or sections rather than just notes would be helpful as well."

   - Dec 2nd 16:40 "Tomorrow we could try to give Malcolm what he wants."

   - Dec 2nd 16:41 "Saving all of the transcripts for research might be nice too."

   - Dec 2nd 16:42 "Verbally being able to go back to or switch between conversation threads could be interesting, like moving between email chains."

   - Dec 2nd 16:43 "It feels less cozy to be talking with an agent than to have a verbal tool on hand."

   - Dec 2nd 16:45 "Verbal Zettelkasten."

   - Dec 2nd 16:48 "Envisioning a system for verbal orientation—a tool that helps situate oneself in real time, chase down relevant threads, and clarify purpose. It's like an interactive verbal mind palace, Zettelkasten, and whiteboard combined. Includes a multiplayer aspect for sharing and collaborating. More than just managing ideas; it's about navigating meaning, direction, and relevance in a dynamic, interactive way."

   - Dec 2nd 16:49 "Tomorrow could be about evolving these notes into cards which display on the screen, helping to visualize and organize ideas."

   - Dec 2nd 16:50 "Not being interrupted is a big deal."

   - Dec 2nd 16:51 "Harri wants us to build a post-rap forum. Verbal changing of things in the UI wants to be instant and responsive, maybe a ding."

   - Dec 2nd 16:54 "Tomorrow could also be about having a sidebar, and the sidebars are all of the days. Under the days are the main post, the conversation logs, the texts, the Claude code logs, etc."

that was a mistake, I started reading them a got a bit lost. also i was reading with my audience eyes on.

"a verbal whiteboard"

"Envisioning a system for verbal orientation — a tool that helps situate oneself in real time, chase down relevant threads, and clarify purpose. It's like an interactive verbal mind palace, Zettelkasten, and whiteboard combined. Includes a multiplayer aspect for sharing and collaborating. More than just managing ideas; it's about navigating meaning, direction, and relevance in a dynamic, interactive way."

"Tomorrow could be about evolving these notes into cards which display on the screen, helping to visualize and organize ideas."

cards

where is the content split into cards and from where is it accessed?
is the answer to both these questions "builder.js"?

ah but the librarian needs to access them no?

librarian <-> cf worker <-> git ?

please build a js file which takes an md file and turns it into "cards"
by default one markdown file is one card
if the markdown file contains \n- - -\n then we split on that and that file contains multiple cards
the first header a card contains is it's "title"
a card also has the file it's from relative to the workspace root.
please build a js file which takes an md file and outputs the cards json

let's restructure build.js to turn post.md into "cards", and then to build the post based on the cards (which could come from any source, post.md or otherwise)

cards have markdown content, and we will need to pass each to 'marked' to build them independently, and then we lay them out on the page

ok, let's make a js file which "adds a card" to an md file, that is it appends "- - -" + some text with an optional user and time.

can you add a white hovering button in the lower right-hand border of the page with a simple black and white comment and microphone and a icon and black border.

when tapping this microphone please start recording an audio message. the audio message should be saved to local storage, every 3s or so it should flush the audio buffer to local storage such that if the recording is interrupted things are saved.

when the recording is finished it should upload the audio to the /voice-comment api.

if it fails it should show a modal "upload failed, click to save" which will download it.

we'll need to add a voice-comment api that mirrors the comment.js api but that obviously accepts audio. the api will need to use the open-ai transcription service to transcribe the audio.

it should save it as markdown with a audio html element and a base64 blob, as well as the transcript. it should save it as a card in voice-comments.md.

for both comment and voice-comment.js we need to detect if there's been a race condition and someone has committed to that file and we should retry 3 times (check the file out, append, and then submit).

we should display the voice comments in a grey circle along with the first two initials of the user's name (ask in a popup the first time they go to record, use the same local storage entry as the comment name).

can you add a different white hovering button but it's a microphone + an icon for "margin" and this one is voice-margin.js and it saves to the user's margin file.

Ok, let's make a refactor to the system

The worker needs to check if any of the days expose "index.js" in the root of the folder.

If they do, then it executes index.js and serves the result as html.

Let's do that, and then update day-4 to serve the post + comments.

It should serve them using the file system if we're running on dev.

if the DEV env var isn't set then we should serve them using the github raw content api.
