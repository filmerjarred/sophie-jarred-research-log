Early morning
    S: I had an idea for the first thing to ship! What could be the bootstrapping kernel for? 
        - our blog post writing pipeline
        - “a place for things to land” for ship December 
        - system 4 for ship December
    J: I've written a highly provisional 1st entry for our research log 😄😅😬.
    J: I also had an mvp idea in the form of webpage that voice records to a google doc for Harri

First meeting
    Orient via reading Jarred's provisional 1st entry
    Make a substack
    Explore what it means to "ship something"

    Jarred gave a whole speech about bootstrapping a system 4

    Pivot from voice notes-Google doc pipeline to markdown-to website pipeline
        Why? According to Sophie: Because I first needed a place for things to land in order to think about new projects. And now I have one
        Something familiar about having a system 3 but together. Dare I say ... A system 4?

Second meeting
    Jarred: 
        1. We have a domain name
        2. There's a GitHub repo and inside the GitHub repo there's a filed day-1/post.md
        3. The text of that markdown file changes appears on the website.
